# tetracorder-lite

Containerized USGS Tetracorder (v6) for EMIT mineral identification, with a Python
CLI (`tetrapy`) that drives the full pipeline — convolving the spectral library for a
new calibration epoch, setting up and running tetracorder, and aggregating the results
into L2B mineral products — from a single YAML config.

Note - this is not the authoritative version of Tetracorder. Please see [here](https://github.com/PSI-edu/spectroscopy-tetracorder)
if that's what you're after.  This version is what is used by EMIT - the core code is consistent,
and we will work to keep this in-sync with the original codebase.  Major difference are that this
version does not hold all convolved libraries to keep the containers small (they are instead
intended to be convolved by the the container).  Python scripts for output conversion
are also included, and will be expanded upon in the future.

This repository is also a work in progress,
that we are continuing to try and revise and simplify to aid in community use and uptake
of Tetracorder.  Suggested contributions are welcome as PRs.

## Try it in a codespace

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/jl-0/tetracorder-lite/tree/build-davinci-multiarch?quickstart=1)

A guided walkthrough: run Tetracorder over a 300x150 window of a real EMIT L2A
scene, one step at a time, and see the mineral maps at the end. No install, no
configuration; about ten minutes of which nine are the run itself.

The badge opens `build-davinci-multiarch`, and the demo scripts pull the image
built from whichever branch the codespace checked out -- so this one runs the
multi-architecture image with DaVinci compiled from vendored source, native on
both amd64 and arm64.

The codespace opens on a terminal and does nothing until you run
`.devcontainer/get-started.sh`, which takes each step on request and resumes correctly if
you stop and restart the codespace. See
[`.devcontainer/README.md`](.devcontainer/README.md) for how it is put together
and how to point it at a different scene.

## Docker or Podman

Either works. Podman implements the same command-line interface, so every
example below runs unchanged under `podman` — substitute the command name and
nothing else. The only additions Podman ever needs are volume suffixes on
SELinux systems, covered below.

**Install** — follow the official instructions, they change more often than this
file does:

| | Docker | Podman |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) | [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/windows-install) |
| macOS | [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) | [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/macos-install) |
| Linux | [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) | [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation#installing-on-linux) |

### Windows: use WSL 2

Both engines run Linux containers on Windows through a WSL 2 virtual machine, so
install WSL first. From an administrator PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

Reboot, and you have WSL 2 with Ubuntu. Then either install Docker Desktop and
turn on **Settings → Resources → WSL integration** for your distribution, or
install Podman Desktop and let it create a Podman machine for you. Either way you
end up running `docker` or `podman` from inside the WSL shell.

**Keep the data on the Linux side.** Put your scenes and output under your WSL
home (`/home/you/...`), not under `/mnt/c/...`. Bind mounts that cross into the
Windows filesystem go through a translation layer, and a full scene writes 8,516
files — the difference is not subtle. You can still reach those files from Explorer
at `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\you`. Faster still is to write output to a named volume; see
[where `/output` lives](#on-macos-and-windows-where-output-lives-changes-the-runtime).

Details: [WSL install](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) ·
[Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/) ·
[Podman on WSL](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/windows-install)

### Architecture

The published image covers **linux/amd64 and linux/arm64**, so Apple Silicon, an
arm64 Linux box and Windows on ARM all pull a native image and no `--platform`
flag is needed anywhere. None of the examples below carry one.

This was not always true. ASU distributes DaVinci only as an amd64 `.deb`, which
made the image amd64-only and meant an arm64 host had to ask for emulation by
hand or be refused with `no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8`. The image now
compiles DaVinci from vendored source instead — see
[`vendor/davinci/VENDOR.md`](vendor/davinci/VENDOR.md) — which is what removed the
constraint.

If you need a specific architecture, for instance to compare results under
emulation, ask for it as usual:

```
--platform=linux/amd64
```

### If you are using Podman

Nothing in the examples changes — `--rm`, `-v`, `-e` and the rest mean the same
thing to both. Two things are worth knowing anyway:

* **SELinux** (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS): add `:z` to bind mounts, as in
  `-v /path/to/input:/data:z`. Without it the container cannot read the mount.
  This is the one flag Docker has no equivalent for.
* **Rootless**: files written to `/output` come back owned by you, not by root,
  which is usually what you want.

## Quick start

Most people run the whole pipeline in one container call and never install
`tetrapy` themselves. Put the scene's ENVI files in one directory and run:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/scenes:/data \
  -v tetra-out:/output \
  tetracorder-lite \
  tetrapy run config.yml \
    --data.rfl       /data/<scene>_rfl \
    --data.rfluncert /data/<scene>_uncert \
    --data.glt       /data/<scene>_glt
```

This convolves the spectral library onto the scene's wavelength grid, runs
Tetracorder, writes COGs, and aggregates the result into L2B mineral products under
`/output/test/`. Point `--data.*` at the data files, not the `.hdr`s. The examples
use `tetracorder-lite` as the image name, which is the tag
[Building the container](#building-the-container) produces. If your image has a
different name, use that instead.

`tetra-out` is a named volume, which is the fast choice on macOS and Windows. Copy
the results out when the run finishes. See
[where `/output` lives](#on-macos-and-windows-where-output-lives-changes-the-runtime).
On Linux you can bind-mount a host directory, for example `-v /path/to/output:/output`.

## Running the container

### How a container call is put together

Every call has the same two halves. Everything up to and including the image name
is the container method: which engine, which mounts, which image. Everything after
the image name is the command that runs inside the container:

```
docker run --rm -v …:/data -v …:/output IMAGE   tetrapy <command> config.yml [--key value …]
└──────────────── container method ────────┘   └──────────── runs inside the container ──────────┘
```

| Part | What it is |
|---|---|
| `docker run --rm` | Engine. `podman run --rm` works the same way (see [Docker or Podman](#docker-or-podman)) |
| `-v …:/data` | Your input scenes. Read-only access is enough |
| `-v …:/output` | Where results are written |
| `IMAGE` | `tetracorder-lite` in these examples; substitute your image's name |
| `tetrapy <command>` | The command to run. The image's default command is bare `tetrapy`, and anything you put after the image name replaces it, so `tetrapy` must be typed out |
| `config.yml` | The default config baked into the image (at `/root/config.yml`, the working directory) |
| `--key value` | Overrides for any config value (see below) |

**The rest of this README shows commands in their short form**, such as
`tetrapy run config.yml …` or `tetrapy aggregate config.yml`. Run them by putting
your container method in front, exactly as in the Quick start. Mounts and engine
flags go before the image name. Config overrides go after `config.yml`.

### Common options

Add these after `config.yml`. Quote any value that contains spaces, so your shell
passes it as a single argument.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--output.base /output/<run>` | Writes this run under its own directory. Tetracorder's output directory is wiped at the start of each run, so give each run its own `base` if you want to keep earlier results |
| `--data.glt ""` | No GLT. COGs are written in raw instrument geometry instead of being orthorectified |
| `--sensor.deleted_channels "…"` | Channels Tetracorder ignores. **The default list is for EMIT and must be changed for any other sensor** (see below) |
| `--<stage>.enabled False` | Skips a pipeline stage, such as `--postprocess.enabled False` (see [The pipeline](#the-pipeline)) |

To check the resolved config without running anything, replace `run` with `preview`:

```sh
docker run --rm tetracorder-lite \
  tetrapy preview config.yml --output.base /output/run2
```

### Example: a non-EMIT sensor (deleted channels)

Tetracorder blanks the deleted channels in every reference spectrum before it fits
anything, so the list decides which absorption features can be matched. The
built-in list is EMIT's 285-channel list:

```
1t4 75t79 99t106 128t148 188t214 218 219t221 226 280t285c
```

On another sensor's grid those numbers point at the wrong wavelengths. The run
still finishes, but the identifications are wrong, or a group identifies nothing
because its continuum endpoints were deleted. Always pass the list that matches
the sensor:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/scenes:/data \
  -v tetra-out:/output \
  tetracorder-lite \
  tetrapy run config.yml \
    --data.rfl       /data/<scene>_rfl \
    --data.rfluncert /data/<scene>_uncert \
    --data.glt       "" \
    --output.base    /output/aviris-2019 \
    --sensor.deleted_channels "1 61t66 81t84 102t117 150t170 175 176 179 181"
```

The syntax:

* `NtM` deletes channels N through M, inclusive. A bare number deletes one channel.
* Channels are **1-based**. If you start from a 0-based band index or an ENVI bad
  band list, add 1.
* Leave off the trailing `c` that the Tetracorder files use. tetrapy adds it when
  it writes the file.

USGS-curated lists for several AVIRIS years ship in the image under
`/root/tetracorder/tetracorder.cmds/tetracorder6.00a.cmds/DELETED.channels/`, for
example `delete_aviris_2019`. Copy the first line up to the `c`. To list them:

```sh
docker run --rm tetracorder-lite \
  ls /root/tetracorder/tetracorder.cmds/tetracorder6.00a.cmds/DELETED.channels
```

### Using your own config

For repeated runs of the same kind, for example one sensor, copy
[`config.yml`](config.yml), edit it, and mount it into the container:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/scenes:/data \
  -v tetra-out:/output \
  -v "$PWD/config.aviris.yml:/config/config.aviris.yml:ro" \
  tetracorder-lite \
  tetrapy run /config/config.aviris.yml --data.rfl /data/<scene>_rfl
```

Overrides still apply on top of a mounted config.

## Building the container

```sh
docker build -f Containerfile -t tetracorder-lite .
```

The image compiles specpr + Tetracorder (Fortran/ratfor) and DaVinci (C), then
sets up the `tetrapy` Python environment with uv. DaVinci builds from the
vendored source in [`vendor/davinci`](vendor/davinci/VENDOR.md) in a separate
stage, so the compilers and source do not end up in the finished image.

The build is native on both amd64 and arm64, so nothing here is emulated. To
build for the architecture you are not on, which *is* emulated and much slower:

```sh
docker buildx build --platform=linux/arm64 -f Containerfile -t tetracorder-lite .
```

## The pipeline

`tetrapy run <config.yml>` runs these stages in order. Each stage has an `enabled`
flag in the config, so you can run any subset:

| Stage | Config key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Export matrix | `export_matrix` | Decode the expert system and write its material matrix to CSV (off by default) |
| Convolve | `convolve` | Convolve the reference and research master libraries onto the scene's wavelength grid |
| Sensor | `sensor` | Wire the convolved libraries into Tetracorder under `sensor.name`: the restart, deleted-channels, enable/disable and color files |
| Setup | `setup` | Configure a Tetracorder run (`cmd-setup-tetrun`) |
| Tetrun | `tetrun` | Execute the configured run (`cmd.runtet`) |
| Postprocess | `postprocess` | Convert matched Tetracorder outputs into COGs and/or delete matched paths |
| Aggregate | `aggregate` | Aggregate Tetracorder outputs into L2B mineral/uncertainty products |

When tetrapy starts, it writes the resolved config (after interpolation and CLI
overrides) to `log.config`, `/output/test/aggregate/config.yml` by default, for
provenance.

## Configuration

The config is a nested YAML file. `output`, `data` and `tetracorder` hold shared
values, `log` controls logging, and the remaining keys are the pipeline stages, each
gated by its own `enabled` flag. Paths refer to locations **inside the container**.
This is the default [`config.yml`](config.yml) baked into the image:

```yaml
output:
  base:        /output/test
  tetracorder: ${output.base}/tetracorder   # Tetracorder's run directory; wiped at the start of setup
  tetrapy:     ${output.base}/aggregate     # tetrapy's log, COGs and L2B products
data:                                       # Data files, not the .hdr

  rfluncert: /data/rfluncert                # Reflectance uncertainty

### Interpolation (`${...}`)

Values may reference other parts of the config with `${...}` syntax, resolved when
the config is loaded (after CLI overrides are applied):

- `${output.base}` — absolute dotted path from the top of the config.
- `${.key}` — a **relative** reference, resolved within the same subsection.

This is why most overrides only need one key. `--output.base /output/run2` moves
every output path, because `output.tetracorder`, `output.tetrapy`, the log and the
COG directory are all derived from it. Likewise `sensor.name` feeds `convolve.name`
and `tetracorder.sensor`, so the convolved libraries, the command-tree files and the
run all use the same sensor key.

### Overriding config on the CLI

Any config value can be overridden without editing the file, using dotted `--key`
flags after the config path. Values are parsed as Python literals (so lists, numbers,
and booleans work), falling back to a string if parsing fails. Shown in short form;
prefix your [container method](#how-a-container-call-is-put-together):

```sh
tetrapy run config.yml \
  --output.base /output/run2 \
  --data.rfl /data/scene_rfl \
  --tetrun.enabled True \
  --tetrun.args '["band", 10, "gif"]'
```

Override the leaf key, not the section it is in. `--output /output/run2`
replaces the whole `output:` block with a string, and the config then fails to load
with `Interpolation reference '${output.tetrapy}' not found`.

You can also load and run just one subsection with `-s/--section`.

## Commands

The image's default command is `tetrapy`. As a default command rather than an
entrypoint, it is replaced by whatever follows the image name, which is why every
call spells out `tetrapy <command>`. `run` is the usual command. The individual
stages are also exposed as standalone subcommands for debugging or partial runs.
Each one runs with the same [container method](#how-a-container-call-is-put-together)
as `run`:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `run` | Execute the full pipeline from a YAML config (the primary interface) |
| `export_matrix` | Export the expert system's material matrix to CSV |
| `convolve` | Convolve the spectral libraries onto a scene's grid |
| `sensor` | Write the sensor's restart, deleted-channels, enable/disable and color files |
| `setup` | Configure a tetracorder run only (`cmd-setup-tetrun`) |
| `tetrun` | Execute a previously-configured run (`cmd.runtet`) |
| `postprocess` | Convert matched tetracorder outputs into COGs and/or delete matched paths |
| `aggregate` | Aggregate tetracorder outputs into L2B mineral/uncertainty products |
| `preview` | Print the resolved config without running anything |

Use `--help` on any command for full options:

```sh
docker run --rm tetracorder-lite tetrapy --help
docker run --rm tetracorder-lite tetrapy run --help
```

## Volume contract

| Mount point | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/data` | Input: reflectance file (ENVI format with `.hdr`) — supplies the target grid |
| `/output` | Output: tetracorder results and aggregated L2B products |

The unconvolved master libraries (`splib06b`, `sprlb06b`; ~24 MB total) are **baked
into the image** at `/root/tetracorder/sl1/usgs/library06.conv/`, so a normal run only
needs the scene mounted at `/data`. The `convolve` stage reads its target
wavelength/FWHM grid from the reflectance ENVI header (`${data.rfl}.hdr`), so the
convolved library self-consistently matches the scene.

### On macOS and Windows, where `/output` lives changes the runtime

A full scene writes **8,516 files**. On Linux that costs nothing — the daemon shares
your kernel and a bind mount is an ordinary path. On macOS and Windows every
container runs inside a Linux VM, and a bind mount of a host directory crosses a
file-sharing layer that charges per filesystem operation. Thousands of small
creates, writes, gzips and renames is the worst possible shape for it.

Measured on an M5 Max under Colima (4 CPU, virtiofs), full EMIT granule
`emit20250327t212148`, 1242x1280x285, everything else held constant:

| `/output` on | total | `tetrun` | CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| a named volume | **6m 42s** | 5m 58s | 200% |
| a host bind mount | 24m 23s | 23m 31s | 71% |

Same image, same scene, byte-identical `agg.nc` — **3.6x**, purely from where the
output went. The CPU column is the tell: on the volume the run never drops below one
core, on the bind mount it sits under one core 79% of the time with the rest idle,
waiting on the filesystem. Raising the VM's CPU allocation does not help, because
cores were never the constraint.

So on macOS and Windows, write to a volume and copy out at the end:

```sh
docker volume create tetra-out
docker run --rm -v /path/to/input:/data -v tetra-out:/output \
  tetracorder-lite tetrapy run config.yml \
    --data.rfl /data/<scene>_rfl --data.rfluncert /data/<scene>_uncert
# one bulk pass, ~11 s for 1.8 GB -- the cost is per-operation, not per-byte
docker run --rm -v tetra-out:/output -v "$PWD/results:/host" \
  tetracorder-lite cp -a /output/. /host/
```

Input can stay bind-mounted: it is two large sequential reads, which this layer
handles fine.

On **Windows** the equivalent already appears under [Windows: use WSL 2](#windows-use-wsl-2)
— keeping data in your WSL home rather than `/mnt/c/...` avoids the much more
expensive crossing into NTFS. A named volume is still the safer instruction, since
with the WSL 2 backend your files and the Docker daemon live in different distros.
On **Linux**, ignore all of this and bind-mount whatever you like.

## Convolved spectral library

Tetracorder matches observed reflectance against a spectral library convolved to the
instrument's channels. When EMIT gets a new calibration (new wavelengths/FWHM), the
library must be regenerated. The `convolve` stage does this in **pure Python** — no
previously-convolved library is needed as a template. It builds the reference
(`splib06b`) and research (`sprlb06b`) libraries by Gaussian-convolving each master
spectrum from its native grid onto the target EMIT grid (with native-FWHM quadrature
correction, matching the USGS Fortran math), writing valid specpr libraries plus ENVI
exports for the aggregator.

The `sensor` stage then wires the convolved libraries into the tetracorder command
tree (restart, color, disable, datasets, and deleted-channels files) under
`sensor.name`, so the subsequent Setup/Tetrun stages use them.

See [`docs/convolved-library-build.md`](docs/convolved-library-build.md) for the full
technical reference on the convolution.

## Development

The Python CLI lives in `tetrapy/`. Managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv sync --all-extras
uv run tetrapy --help
```

Running `tetrapy` outside the container is for development. The pipeline stages that
call Tetracorder need the binaries and command tree that only the image provides.

The build context is filtered by two files that must be changed together:
`.dockerignore`, which only Docker reads, and `.containerignore`, which Podman
prefers. If either drifts, that engine ships the whole working tree — including
any scenes downloaded under `in/` — into the context and bakes it into the image.

| USGS splib06 / sprlb06 spectral libraries | `tetracorder/sl1/` | from spectroscopy-tetracorder |
| [DaVinci](https://davinci.asu.edu) (ASU Mars Space Flight Facility) | `vendor/davinci/src/` ([VENDOR.md](vendor/davinci/VENDOR.md)) | [GPL-2.0-or-later](vendor/davinci/src/LICENSE) |

DaVinci is vendored as source at upstream revision r19810 and compiled during the
build, rather than installed from ASU's prebuilt `.deb`. Its tree carries a few
components under their own terms -- the Xvic widgets (Caltech, 3-clause BSD),
libcsv and libltdl (LGPL-2.1), and the libtiff, libpng, giflib and libjpeg copies
bundled inside `iomedley/` (all permissive). [NOTICE](NOTICE) lists each with its
license file.

The container image is an aggregate of separate programs, each keeping its own
license. Because the Containerfile copies the repository into the image, the
complete corresponding source for the GPL components travels inside the image
itself -- `/root/vendor/davinci/src` and `/root/tetracorder` -- so GPL-2 section
3(a) and GPL-3 section 6(a) are met without a separate written offer.
