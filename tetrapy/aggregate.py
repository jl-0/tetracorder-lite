    Aggregate one tetracorder group into band-depth / mineral-id maps.

    Walks every decoded block in ``group``, loads its ``.depth``/``.fit`` outputs,
    and composites them into a two-band ``(band, y, x)`` array: band 0 is the scaled
    band depth, band 1 is the (1-based) mineral index of the winning block per pixel.
    A matching uncertainty array carries the Clark-2003 band-depth uncertainty (band
    0) and the fit (band 1). Uncertainty is only computed when the reflectance inputs
    and libraries are supplied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    decoder : TetraDecoder
        Decoded expert system providing the blocks and their output paths.
    group : int
        Group number to aggregate (e.g. ``1`` or ``2``).
    rfl : xarray.DataArray, optional
        Observed reflectance as ``(y, x, band)`` carrying a ``wavelength`` coordinate,
        aligned with the depth/fit rasters. Required (with ``uncert`` and ``libs``)
        for uncertainty.
    uncert : xarray.DataArray, optional
        Observed reflectance uncertainty, same shape/ordering as ``rfl``.
    libs : dict[str, dict], optional
        Library id -> ``{"records": [...], "rfl": ndarray}`` as produced by
        :func:`read_library`. Its presence is what enables the uncertainty band.
    ref : pandas.DataFrame, optional
        Reference matrix mapping material ``title`` to a stable ``index``. When
        given, the mineral-id band uses that index instead of the running block
        counter; a material missing from the matrix is assigned a negative id and
        logged.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[xarray.Dataset | None, xarray.Dataset | None]
        ``(mins, minuncert)`` over the ``(downtrack, crosstrack)`` dimensions.
        ``mins`` carries the scaled band depth (``group_{group}_band_depth``) and
        mineral id (``group_{group}_mineral_id``); ``minuncert`` carries the
        band-depth uncertainty (``group_{group}_band_depth_unc``) and fit
        (``group_{group}_fit``).

        A group whose materials were all read but won no pixels returns zero-filled
        products, not ``None`` — a mineral id of ``0`` already means "no material
        identified", which is the correct result over full cloud, snow or water.
        ``(None, None)`` is returned only when no depth raster could be read at all,
        which means tetracorder wrote nothing for the group.
